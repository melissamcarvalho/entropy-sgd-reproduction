## Biasing gradient descent into wide valleys (wide on different perspectives)

[Chaudhari et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01838) defines that a stationary point is located on a wider/flatter valley of the energy landscape, if the marginal likelihood of the energy landscape at this point is larger. The energy landscape is defined by the local entropy loss function. Complementing this definition, [Jiang et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02178) describes several generalization measures including those that aim to calculate the flatness of a minimum point. As a consequence, calculating the flatness of a stationary point found by the local entropy loss function with the recent proposed flatness measures is a temptative to converge efforts on the community around the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks. This repository was organized based on two repositories: [UCLA-vision repository](https://github.com/ucla-vision/entropy-sgd/tree/master/python), and [robust-generalization-measures repository](https://github.com/nitarshan/robust-generalization-measures/blob/master/data/generation/measures.py).
